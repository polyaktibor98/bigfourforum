# bigfourforum
(Szakdolgozat)

This is a forum-like web application hosted on render.com.
The main topic is the four USA major leagues, frequently referred as "Big Four" - NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL.
I have used Python and the Flask web framework, along with SQLite (later PostreSQL) and SQLAlchemy ORM to maintain the backend functionality.
In terms of frontend, I have used HTML, Bootstrap, and Jinja trio (no JavaScript).

The application is available at the following URL - https://big-four-forum.onrender.com/
